Simple space invaders game written in D, adapted from <http://nicktasios.nl/posts/space-invaders-from-scratch-part-1.html>. 
I came across that blog post and decided to write the game in D & GLFW.

Note: I am adapting the code to how I see fit. It might not be fully the same as the blog post. 

P.S. I will try to clean up the code in the near future.
